### What is moa(db)?
Moa(db) is a open source PHP **[MongoDB](http://mongodb.org)** GUI. The project is focused on a very simple interface and a drag & drop setup.
Helpful query validation, amazing lightweight UI , JSON imports & exports, SSL support and much more in the box.

Chome, Firefox, Safari. 
Some call it a limitation, but I'am calling it a feature: No support for IE at this time.

### Getting Started

moa(db) works with PHP5+ and requires **[Mongo PHP Driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-driver/tree/master)** to be installed and running.

To setup moa(db) :

 	- Copy the `moaDB` folder to a secure path on your web site.
 
Then your done, but you might want to :

 	- Change the `.htaccess` file in order to block unwanted authorization.
	- Check out the config settings in `resources/php/config.php`.

Finally go to the URL pointing to moaDB on your web site.
